# Kai's junk code

Following the idea of [Tridge's junk code](http://junkcode.samba.org/), a
repository of small code snippets I have written but never released as a full
project.

I'm putting them out there in the hope that they might be useful to someone,
to keep a reference for myself. As Tridge put it, I call this junk code because
I have no plans to document, package or properly support anything in this
repository.

If you find a bug you consider worth fixing, send me a pull request and I'll
gladly take a look.

## Downloading

the code in a piece of free software and the GPL doesn't meet your needs for
some reason then feel free to contact me and I may offer that bit of code
under a different license.
